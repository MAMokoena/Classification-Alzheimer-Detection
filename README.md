# Classification-Alzheimer-Detection
Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify Alzheimer's disease based on patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical history. It leverages Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest  and Logistic Regression to predict Alzheimer's diagnosis.

üîç Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing correlations and distributions of risk factors.
Model Training & Evaluation: Comparing different ML models for classification accuracy.

Feature Importance: Identifying key predictors for Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis.


Data includes age, BMI, cognitive test scores, lifestyle habits, and genetic risk factors.
